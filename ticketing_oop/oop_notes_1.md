## Object oriented programming

-   Objects have
    -   characteristics/contents (What they have)
    -   capabilities (What they can do)
-   Examples
    -   Bank Account:
        -   characteristics (Member):
            -   account number
            -   balance
            -   username
            -   account type
            -   transactions
            -   status
        -   capabilities (Method):
            -   transfer
            -   withdraw
            -   close
    -   Car:
        -   Characteristics:
            -   engine
            -   seats
            -   tyres
            -   ..
        -   Capabilities:
            -   Start
            -   stop
            -   commute
-   objects: This represents a real world entity (your specific bank account)
-   classes: This represents a blueprint which is used to create objects
-   relations between classes/objects
    -   is-a (Inheritence)
    -   has-a (composition)
